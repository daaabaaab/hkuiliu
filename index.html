<h3>Lions are very interesting animals. As the kings and queens of the animal kingdom, they are very powerful and needed in the jungle. Facts listed below.</h3>
<br>
<h3>Fact 1: Male lions live from 12-16 years and females live from 15-18 years. Thats not that long for a beast like a lion if you think about it.</h3>
<br>
<h3>Fact 2: Lions eat 18 pounds of meat every day! Thats literally 60 hamburgers for a human being like us. Almost impossible to eat in a day.</h3>
<br>
<h3> Fact 3: Lions can jump/leap about 20 feet! Thats basically 2-4 people stacked onto each other!!</h3>
<br>
<h3>Fact 4: Lions eat african buffalos, wildebeests and many zebra. I'd never eat that no matter what you'd give me.</h3>
<br>
<h3>Fact 5: Lions roar at night and the sounds can reach up to 8 km and 114 decibels. If I was near the lion, my ears would completely shut down.</h3>
